# Prosper Loans Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis in R using credit data from Prosper. Prosper is an American based peer-to-peer lending platform. The platform is used to match borrow with investor.

The dataset has 81 variables in total of which a number of them are explored throughout the EDA. The dataset is quite robust at a total of 113,937 rows. The data covers three
main areas; the investor, the borrower and the loan itself. This EDA primarily focused on the borrowers. 

This EDA contains 3 segments in increasing order of complexity: Univariate Plots, Bivariate Plots, and Multivariate Plots, as well as a Reflection segment at the end that summarizes my experience and thoughts throughout this EDA.
